- 👋 Hi, I’m @regentCracker
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in pure math but code from time to time.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for a bachelor's degree (in math) and train with the Israeli team for the [IMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any anything that's cool, really.
- 📫 You can reach me by email I guess - <orenkosch@gmail.com>
